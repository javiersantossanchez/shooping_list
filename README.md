# shoopinglist

A practice project to work with **Flutter Framework**, the main idea of this project is start my learning path with this framework. The project is a basic implementation for an application to controlling you buys on a grocery.   

The user can: 
- Create a list with several item for buy (The system has a default list of item to be select)
- See all the list created by the user
- Mark the items inside each list (To control the items you already took in the grocery)
- Delete list

All the data is store inside the device's file system. in future I want store the data in the cloud. I need think about the best way to implement this feature.
